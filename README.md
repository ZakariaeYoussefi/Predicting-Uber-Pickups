## What I Learned  
Working on this Uber demand prediction project allowed me to develop and strengthen several skills, including:  

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Handling missing data, outliers, and noisy datasets.  
  - Combining multiple datasets, including weather data and borough mapping information, for feature engineering.  

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Extracting time-based features such as hour of the day, day of the week, and month.  
  - Creating location-based features to improve demand prediction accuracy.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Visualizing trends in ride demand across time and geographic areas.  
  - Identifying relationships between demand patterns and external factors like weather.  

- **Machine Learning Model Implementation**:  
  - Building and evaluating predictive models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or ARIMA for forecasting.  
  - Optimizing hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.  

- **Insights and Recommendations**:  
  - Using predictive analytics to suggest strategies for optimizing urban transportation.  
  - Identifying peak times and areas with high demand to allocate resources efficiently.
